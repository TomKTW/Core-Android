# Kobalt Core library for Android
This is an Android library used in my apps.

## Features
- Could be compatible up to Android 1.0+ (tested with Android 2.3+)
- Written mostly in Kotlin
- Using minimal amount of libraries to keep compatibility with older Android versions
- Attempting to separate from Android framework as much as possible
